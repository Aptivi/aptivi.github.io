	<CardPicture Title="Who are we?">
		We, Aptivi, were established in 2014 as an initial PC repair and expertise center to save the world.
		Over time, we are getting expanded to programming, so we have made some of the projects that we are
		proud of. We are not only interested in PCs, but also interested in technology in general, which is
		our main role. We strive to improve the technology life and to make technology easier in the future,
		especially the computers. We are Aptivi, where tech changes! The triangle in our logo represents the
		“Prism of the Tech Future.” We're established as an independent community on 2014 when we were
		nameless, and we constantly deliver the best solutions to all the problems you may be facing, as well
		as we innovate new ideas for our new projects.
