<Hero Title="Aptivi Branding">
	Thanks for your interest in our branding's press kit! Aptivi's modern branding
	can be used in your design, and we are open to providing the kit!
</Hero>
<Jumbotron Title="Why are we providing this press kit?">
	Our Aptivi branding kit is a press kit that allows other publications to use our logos
	and designs to more accurately represent us in their work. This press kit provides a wide
	variety of designs that express our brand to allow others to use our assets when
	pressing articles, presentations, and so on. Templates and sounds are also included for
	people interested in contributing a presentation or an asset for us and our projects, and
	we've made it easier for them by integrating template files. As we are proud of our
	branding, this press kit is, proudly, available for free, too.
</Jumbotron>
<Features FeatureArray="@LogoAssets" />
<Jumbotron Title="What about other assets?">
	We are not only providing the brand logos (normal and monochrome, with and without the
	logotype), the wallpapers (standard VGA resolution, widescreen resolutions, old phone
	resolutions, and new phone resolutions, with or without logo), presentation templates
	(PowerPoint template files and .SVG and .AF files for image-based presentations) and
	source assets (which include both .SVG as an open format for the majority of the programs
	and .AF for Affinity Studio v3), but we are also providing other assets that may be useful,
	such as audio branding, which includes a variety of instrumentals, and official fonts, which
	have been chosen carefully during the first stage of the rebrand.
</Jumbotron>

<Hero Title="Download Press Kit" Buttons="@RedirectCallbacks">
	You can download our official branding press kit, but you'll need to read
	the guidelines first.
