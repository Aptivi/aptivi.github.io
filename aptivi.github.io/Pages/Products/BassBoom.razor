		BassBoom is an application and a library, written in .NET with C# as the programming
		langauge, that allows you to play music, sounds, and online radio stations effortlessly,
		without having to write low-level code. This uses the embedded MPG123 library as a backend
		for playing audio, which is the main goal of BassBoom. It uses your platform's audio APIs
		to be able to play your favorite songs. To ensure smooth playback for sound effects and other
		features, BassBoom provides the Play-n-Forget technique that allows your applications to
		play such sounds in certain events, such as when a key is pressed.

		Yes! BassBoom can not only play regular music files that are found in your hard disk, but
		it can also play streamable content, which includes radio stations! You can listen to all
		MPEG-compatible radio stations, just like how you would do it in a real music player. The
		only time that we require an active internet connection is when you're trying to play
		streams available on the internet. You can also take a look at the online radio station
		information when it's playing, regardless of whether's it's a Shoutcast stream or an
		IceCast stream.
