		Nitrocid KS is a kernel simulator, written in .NET using the C# programming language, that
		simulates our future-planned kernel, which is the Nitrocid Kernel. It's more than just a
		kernel simulator; it's an operating system simulator that simulates a command-line shell
		program that runs commands and programs.
